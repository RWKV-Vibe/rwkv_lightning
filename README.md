# rwkv_lightning 🕊️ ⚡
RWKV Batch infer backend Base on [Albatross](https://github.com/BlinkDL/Albatross) 🕊️ and [Robyn](https://github.com/sparckles/Robyn) 🦀 
- Thanks to [Rapid-Sampling](https://github.com/Triang-jyed-driung/Rapid-Sampling) Kernel From [Triang-jyed-driung](https://github.com/Triang-jyed-driung), it also have native HIP kerel compatible with ROCm😎
## Install requirements
**For Nvidia CUDA**
```bash
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130
pip install robyn pydantic ninja numpy 
[optional] pip install flashinfer-python
```
**For AMD ROCm**

(The Flashinfer-python is not transfer to the AMD ROCm officially yet, please wait for the official compatibility. I actually tried to transfer it, but the Flash Infer library is a bit abstract and huge. I use the Pytorch base top_k top_p decode to implement the Flash infer CUDA GPU decode kernel)

**No problem! This could work too. It's not that it can't be used 🫣**
```bash
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm6.4
pip install robyn pydantic ninja numpy 
```

## Usage
```bash
python app.py --model-path <your model path> --port <your port number> --password rwkv7_7.2b
```
- if no password, you can do not add ```--password``` flag


## Test API quickly
```bash
bash ./test/test_curl.sh
```

## Tips
If you want to the max performance optimization, you can use the ```torch.compile(mode='max-autotune-no-cudagraphs')```  

you can modify the code in the ```rwkv_batch/rwkv7.py``` line 30, 31
```python
MyFunction = torch.compile(mode='max-autotune-no-cudagraphs')
MyStatic = torch.compile(mode='max-autotune-no-cudagraphs')
```
**But it will be slow in first inference request, Because it needs to compile the Triton kernel firstly.**

### 5. ```state/chat/completions``` [Support state cache manager] 😜

#### Have 3 Levels Cache design 🤓
- **L1 cache(VRAM) 16**
- **L2 cache(RAM) 32**
- **L3 cache(Sqlite3 database)**
#### The all cached state will be stored in the database when shout down the server 😋
- could modify the cache size in ```./state_pool.py``` in line 14-16

***Need to add a unique "session_id": "XXX" in the request body as a unique identifier for each session***👆

**ONLY support for bsz = 1 one session** 🤫

### 7. ```/openai/v1/chat/completions``` [Open AI format support]
- "could be used for chat fronted which OpenAI API compatibility. Such as Cherry studio."
- **Stateless by default.** If you do not send `"session_id"`, the server handles the request as a normal non-stateful OpenAI-compatible completion.
- **Optional state mode via `"session_id"`.** When `"session_id"` is present, the route reuses cached RWKV state for that session and treats the request as an **incremental turn**.
- **Incremental contract in state mode.** When you send `"session_id"`, only send the **new message(s) for this turn**. Do **not** resend the full chat history, otherwise the previous context will be duplicated.
- **Missing state auto-init.** If `"session_id"` is provided but no cached state exists yet, the server automatically creates a fresh state and treats that request as the first turn of the session.
- **Experimental tool-call parsing is non-streaming only.** Set `"stream": false` when you want the server to extract `tool_calls` from the model output.
- When a tool call is parsed successfully, any text before or after the tool-call payload is preserved as the assistant message `content`.
