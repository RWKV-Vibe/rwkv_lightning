# rwkv_lightning 🕊️ ⚡
RWKV Batch infer backend Base on [Albatross](https://github.com/BlinkDL/Albatross) 🕊️ and [fastapi](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi)
- Thanks to [Rapid-Sampling](https://github.com/Triang-jyed-driung/Rapid-Sampling) Kernel From [Triang-jyed-driung](https://github.com/Triang-jyed-driung), it also have native HIP kerel compatible with ROCm😎
## Install requirements
**For Nvidia CUDA**
```bash
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130
pip install fastapi pydantic ninja numpy 
```
**For AMD ROCm**
```bash
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm6.4
pip install fastapi pydantic ninja numpy 
```

## Usage
```bash
python app.py --model-path <your model path> --port <your port number> --password rwkv7_7.2b
```
- if no password, you can do not add ```--password``` flag


## Test API quickly
```bash
bash ./test/test_curl.sh
```

## Tips
If you want to the max performance optimization, you can use the ```torch.compile(mode='max-autotune-no-cudagraphs')```  

you can modify the code in the ```rwkv_batch/rwkv7.py``` line 30, 31
```python
MyFunction = torch.compile(mode='max-autotune-no-cudagraphs')
MyStatic = torch.compile(mode='max-autotune-no-cudagraphs')
```
**But it will be slow in first inference request, Because it needs to compile the Triton kernel firstly.**

### **3. ```state/chat/completions``` [Support state cache manager] 😜**

#### Have 3 Levels Cache design 🤓
- **L1 cache(VRAM) 16**
- **L2 cache(RAM) 32**
- **L3 cache(Sqlite3 database)**
#### The all cached state will be stored in the database when shout down the server 😋
- could modify the cache size in ```./state_pool.py``` in line 14-16

***Need to add a unique "session_id": "XXX" in the request body as a unique identifier for each session***👆

### **8. ```/high_throughput/chat/completions``` [High Throughput]**

This endpoint is disabled by default. Start the API server with `--enable-high-throughput` to enable it:

```bash
python app.py --model-path <your model path> --port <your port number> --password rwkv7_7.2b --enable-high-throughput
```

Optional high-throughput tuning flags have defaults and can be omitted:

- `--high-throughput-max-active-states 256`: resident active state pool size for this endpoint only.
- `--high-throughput-prefill-area 4096`: preferred `batch_size * chunk_size` area for prefill scheduling.
- `--high-throughput-prefill-batch-size 16`: preferred power-of-two prefill batch size.

Only one high-throughput API path is registered:

- `POST /high_throughput/chat/completions`

Compared with `POST /v1/chat/completions`:

- V1 uses the shared prefill queue and allocates request state per call.
- High throughput does not use the V1 prefill queue; it uses its own resident state pool and internal scheduling.
- V1 request batch size follows the old endpoint behavior and its independent queue limit.
- High throughput defaults to at most 256 active resident states, then reuses those states for the next window.
- High throughput supports the same common decode parameters: `max_tokens`, `stop_tokens`, `temperature`, `top_k`, `top_p`, `alpha_presence`, `alpha_frequency`, `alpha_decay`, `stream`, `chunk_size`, and `password`.
- High throughput additionally supports request-level scheduler overrides: `max_batch_size` or `decode_max_batch_size`, `prefill_area`, and `prefill_target_batch_size` or `batch_size`.
- High throughput accepts either V1-style `contents` or item-style `items`. Use `items` when you want stable per-item ids in the response.
